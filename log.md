# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Solved a simple problem from June Long Challenge on codechef.com

**Thoughts:** Forked this github repo to start the challenge from tomorrow and read 1,2 articles on medium.

### Day 1: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Forced Directed Graph d3.js project

**Thoughts:** At first I couldn't find a good resource to learn how to make the forced directed graph, I have been coding in d3 v3 and there wasn't 
a good tutorial on that. But I found out a d3 v4 tutorial and started reading it and eventually I was able to understand it!
So I started coding, but the thing that troubled me the most was the graph was getting out of bounds of the svg. So after looking on the web I finally came around .strength and .distanceMax methods and was able to fit the graph within svg boundaries.

### Day 2: June 4, 2017  
  
**Today's Progress:** Completed the Force Directed Graph d3.js project  
  
**Thoughts:** Added the flag stripes to the nodes of the graph. First I tried adding css stripes using svg:image but that didn't worked, then I had to switch to combination of div and img to include flag stripes.

### Day 7 - June 9, 2017
  
**Thoughts:** Set up my personal blog using WordPress and learned the basics of nodejs from FCC. In setting up my blog the thing that troubled me the most was to set up SSL certificate using Let's encrypt. Godaddy doesn't provide a quick guide to install it and had to spend 2 hours searching how to do so. finally found the site that really served as the best step by step guide to install SSL https://www.sslforfree.com
