# 100 Days Of Code - Log  
  
### Day 0: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Solved a simple problem from June Long Challenge on codechef.com

**Thoughts:** Forked this github repo to start the challenge from tomorrow and read 1,2 articles on medium.

### Day 1: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Forced Directed Graph d3.js project

**Thoughts:** At first I couldn't find a good resource to learn how to make the forced directed graph, I have been coding in d3 v3 and there wasn't 
a good tutorial on that. But I found out a d3 v4 tutorial and started reading it and eventually I was able to understand it!
So I started coding, but the thing that troubled me the most was the graph was getting out of bounds of the svg. So after looking on the web I finally came around .strength and .distanceMax methods and was able to fit the graph within svg boundaries.

### Day 2: June 4, 2017  
  
**Today's Progress:** Completed the Force Directed Graph d3.js project
